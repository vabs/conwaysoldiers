# Conway's Soldiers

This is the implementation of one of the impossible games developed by John Horton Conway. This is a one person checker jumping puzzle. The objective of the game is to make the soldiers (squares) reach as high as possible in the grid.

There have been no proof yet that if a soldier (square) can reach up to level 5.

Give it try yourself.
